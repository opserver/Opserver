            HACK: This is a best effort attempt to divine if a type is anonymous based on the language spec.
            
            Reference section 7.6.10.6 of the C# language spec as of 2012/11/19
            
            It checks:
                - is a class
                - descends directly from object
                - has [CompilerGenerated]
                - has a single constructor
                - that constructor takes exactly the same parameters as its public properties
                - all public properties are not writable
                - has a private field for every public property
                - overrides Equals(object)
                - overrides GetHashCode()

        <member name="M:Jil.Common.Utils.GetAnonymousNameToConstructorMap(System.Type)">
            <summary>
            This returns a map of "name of member" => [Type of member, index of argument to constructor].
            We need this for anonymous types because we can't set properties (they're read-only).
            
            How this works is kind of fun.
            
            By spec, the arguments to the constructor are in declaration order for an anonymous type.
            So: new { A, B, C } => new SomeType(A a, B b, C c)
            
            However there is no way to get declaration order via reflection, it's just not data that's
            preserved.  Furthermore, the names of backing fields for those read-only properties are not
            defined by the spec.
            
            So I got clever.
            
            This method decompiles the constructor to find out which fields are set by which arguments (by index).
            It then decompiles all properties to find out which fields back which properties.
            Then it finally works backwards from each property, taking the property's name type and using it's backing
            field to lookup which index to pass it in as when constructing the anonymous object.
