            No configuration data was found. This means no Opserver sections are configured/enabled or you have no roles assigned to you.
        </p>
        <p>
            See the <code>Readme.txt</code> in /config and <code>*.example.json</code> files for examples of a basic JSON configuration...or you can implement your own provider to get settings from anywhere.

        <p>
            If you are using AD authentication, set the <strong>ViewGroups</strong> or <strong>AdminGroups</strong> settings in the <code>web.config</code> or in the section-specific configuration.

            You can also browse to <a href="~/about">/about</a> to see how you have been authenticated and what monitors have been enabled.
